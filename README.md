1. **Artifact Management Menu:**
   - Choose to keep previous work or start fresh
   - Artifacts = saved progress from previous runs

2. **Task Selection Menu:**
   - Use the default task (NVIDIA stock analysis)
   - Or enter your own custom task
   - Example: "Write a blog about Apple stock performance in Q3 2024"

3. **During Execution:**
   - The AI agents will work together automatically
   - You'll be prompted occasionally to:
     - Press Enter to continue (let agents work)
     - Provide feedback if needed
     - Type 'terminate' to stop early
     - Type 'approved' when satisfied

4. **Final Output:**
   - Find your completed blog post in the `output` folder
   - File will be named like: `report_20241201_143022.md`

### Advanced Usage (Command Line)

```bash
# Run with a custom task directly
python main.py --task "Analyze Tesla stock for the past 3 months"

# Start fresh (clear all previous work)
python main.py --clear-artifacts

# Limit the number of iterations (for faster results)
python main.py --max-inner-turn 5 --max-outer-turn 1

# See all options
python main.py --help
```

## ü§ñ The AI Agents Team (agents.py)

The application uses a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate to create your reports. Here's how each agent works:

### üé© Admin (User Proxy)
**Role**: You, the human supervisor  
**Responsibilities**:
- Provides the initial task to the team
- Reviews work at each stage
- Gives feedback for improvements
- Approves final results

**How to interact**:
- Press **Enter** to let agents continue working
- Type **feedback** to guide the team
- Type **'approved'** when satisfied
- Type **'terminate'** to stop the process

### üìã Planner
**Role**: Project manager and quality controller  
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyzes your task requirements
- Delegates work to appropriate agents
- Reviews code execution results
- Checks report quality and SEO
- Ensures factual accuracy

**Key behaviors**:
- **Always** delegates data fetching to Engineer (never tries to fetch data itself)
- Provides specific requirements (date ranges, metrics, chart types)
- Reviews for interactive code issues (plt.show(), input())
- Marks completion with 'REVIEW_COMPLETE' when satisfied

### üíª Engineer  
**Role**: Technical specialist for data and visualization  
**Responsibilities**:
- Writes Python code to fetch stock data
- Creates data visualizations (charts, graphs)
- Performs calculations and analysis
- Iterates based on feedback

**Technical details**:
- Uses **yfinance** for stock data: `yf.Ticker('NVDA').history(period='1mo')`
- Creates visualizations with **matplotlib**
- Saves data to `coding/data/` folder
- Saves charts to `coding/figures/` folder
- **Never** uses interactive commands (plt.show(), input())
- Always uses non-interactive backend: `matplotlib.use('Agg')`

**Code structure example**:
```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Non-interactive backend
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create directories
os.makedirs('data', exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs('figures', exist_ok=True)

# Fetch and save data
ticker = yf.Ticker('NVDA')
data = ticker.history(period='1mo')
data.to_csv('data/nvda_data.csv')

# Create and save visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(data.index, data['Close'])
plt.savefig('figures/nvda_price.png')
# NO plt.show() - we save instead!
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Executor
**Role**: Code runner and results reporter  
**Responsibilities**:
- Executes Engineer's code
- Reports results and created files
- Shows data statistics
- Provides error messages if code fails

**Safety features**:
- Automatically removes interactive commands
- Replaces `plt.show()` with `plt.savefig()`
- Adds non-interactive backend if missing
- Reports all modifications made

**Execution environment**:
- Working directory: `coding/`
- No Docker required (runs locally)
- Full access to file system for saving

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writer
**Role**: Content creator and SEO specialist  
**Responsibilities**:
- Creates engaging blog posts
- Formats content in Markdown
- Incorporates data and charts
- Optimizes for SEO

**Writing format**:
- Always wraps content in ````md` code blocks
- References charts: `![Chart](figures/chart.png)`
- Uses proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Includes keywords naturally

**Example output structure**:
````md
# Stock Analysis Title

## Introduction
Engaging opening paragraph...

## Market Performance
![Stock Chart](figures/price_chart.png)
Analysis of the chart...

## Key Metrics
- Metric 1: Value
- Metric 2: Value

## Conclusion
Summary and insights...
````

### üìù Summarizer
**Role**: Progress tracker and memory keeper  
**Responsibilities**:
- Creates iteration summaries
- Tracks improvements made
- Lists action items
- Saves progress to artifacts

**Output format**:
- JSON-compatible summaries
- Saved to `artifact/` folder
- Includes metrics and progress
- Enables continuation in future sessions

## üîÑ Agent Communication Flow

The agents work together in a specific workflow:

```
1. Admin ‚Üí provides task ‚Üí Planner
2. Planner ‚Üí analyzes needs ‚Üí Engineer
3. Engineer ‚Üí writes code ‚Üí Executor
4. Executor ‚Üí runs code, reports results ‚Üí Planner
5. Planner ‚Üí reviews results ‚Üí Writer
6. Writer ‚Üí creates blog post ‚Üí Planner
7. Planner ‚Üí reviews content ‚Üí Admin
8. Admin ‚Üí provides feedback ‚Üí (loop or approve)
9. Summarizer ‚Üí creates iteration summary
```

### Speaker Transitions

The system uses **controlled speaker transitions** to ensure orderly conversation:

| From | Can speak to |
|------|-------------|
| Admin | Planner only |
| Planner | Summarizer, Engineer, Writer |
| Engineer | Executor only |
| Executor | Planner only |
| Writer | Planner only |
| Summarizer | Admin only |

This prevents agents from talking out of turn and ensures logical workflow.

## üéÆ How main.py Works

The `main.py` file is the entry point that orchestrates everything:

### 1. **Directory Management**
- Creates and manages 4 main directories:
  - `output/` - Final reports are saved here
  - `coding/` - Temporary Python code and data files
  - `draft/` - Draft versions of blog posts
  - `artifact/` - Memory and progress from previous runs
- Automatically cleans working directories (coding/draft) each run
- Preserves artifacts unless you choose to clear them

### 2. **Smart Artifact Handling**
- **Preserves Progress**: Keeps artifacts from previous sessions by default
- **Memory System**: Remembers what was done in previous runs
- **Clean Start Option**: Can clear everything with `--clear-artifacts`
- **Auto-Recovery**: If terminated early, extracts the latest draft

### 3. **Iteration Control**
- **Outer Iterations**: Major revision cycles (default: 3)
  - Each outer iteration can refine the entire work
  - Builds on previous iterations' feedback
- **Inner Iterations**: Steps within each outer cycle (default: 100)
  - Individual agent interactions
  - Typically: Plan ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Write ‚Üí Review

### 4. **Intelligent Task Processing**
```python
# The main workflow in main.py:
1. Setup directories and load configuration
2. Check for existing artifacts (previous work)
3. Initialize memory manager
4. Create AI agents team
5. Run iterations:
   - Outer loop: Major revisions
     - Inner loop: Agent conversations
       - Planner analyzes task
       - Engineer writes code
       - Executor runs code
       - Writer creates content
       - Admin reviews
6. Extract and save final report
```

### 5. **Error Recovery Features**
- **Auto-save drafts**: Every draft is saved with timestamp
- **Termination handling**: Gracefully saves work when stopped
- **Draft extraction**: Finds latest draft if conversation ends early
- **Fallback search**: Checks multiple locations for reports

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing Agent Behavior

You can modify agent behaviors by editing their system messages in `agents.py`:

### Make Engineer use different data sources
Edit the Engineer's system message to include:
```python
"3. Data sources to use:
   - yfinance for stock data
   - pandas_datareader for economic data
   - Alpha Vantage API for detailed metrics"
```

### Change Writer's style
Edit the Writer's system message to specify style:
```python
"2. Writing style:
   - Professional and analytical
   - Include technical indicators
   - Target audience: experienced investors"
```

### Adjust Planner's review criteria
Edit the Planner's system message for different focus:
```python
"6. Review criteria priorities:
   - Technical accuracy (highest)
   - Data completeness
   - Visual appeal
   - SEO optimization"
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `--task` | Specify task directly | Interactive prompt | `--task "Analyze AAPL stock"` |
| `--max-inner-turn` | Limit agent interactions per outer iteration | 100 | `--max-inner-turn 10` |
| `--max-outer-turn` | Limit major revision cycles | 3 | `--max-outer-turn 2` |
| `--clear-artifacts` | Start fresh, remove all previous work | False | `--clear-artifacts` |
| `--preserve-all` | Debug mode - don't clear any folders | False | `--preserve-all` |
| `--interactive` | Force interactive mode | Auto-detect | `--interactive` |

### Environment Variables for Agent Models

You can assign different AI models to different agents for cost optimization:

```bash
# .env file
AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4              # Default for all agents
AZURE_OPENAI_CODE_WRITER=gpt-4        # Engineer (needs to be smart)
AZURE_OPENAI_CODE_CRITIC=gpt-4        # Planner (needs good judgment)
AZURE_OPENAI_CODE_EXE=gpt-3.5-turbo   # Executor (simpler tasks)
```

## üìä What Kind of Reports Can It Create?

- Stock performance analysis
- Market trend reports
- Company financial summaries
- Investment opportunity assessments
- Comparative stock analyses
- Sector performance reviews

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

- **API Keys:** Keep your `.env` file private - never share or commit to git
- **Data:** Stock data is fetched from public Yahoo Finance API
- **Storage:** All generated content stays on your local machine

## üÜò Getting Help

1. **Check the logs:** Error messages usually explain what went wrong
2. **Review output folder:** Previous successful reports can guide you
3. **Reduce complexity:** Start with simple tasks, then get more complex
4. **Check API limits:** Ensure your Azure account has sufficient quota

## üéØ Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific:** The more detailed your task, the better the output
2. **Let It Run:** Don't terminate early - agents improve with iterations
3. **Provide Feedback:** When prompted, guide the agents toward what you want
4. **Save Artifacts:** Keep artifacts to build upon previous work
5. **Check Charts:** Review the `coding/figures/` folder for generated charts
6. **Understanding Agent Feedback**: 
   - If Planner requests changes, it's improving quality
   - Multiple iterations are normal and beneficial
   - Each agent specializes in their domain

7. **Debugging Issues**:
   - Check `coding/` folder for generated Python files
   - Review `draft/` folder for report iterations
   - Look for error messages from Executor

## üìà Understanding the Output

Your final report will include:
- **Headlines & Sections:** Properly formatted with markdown
- **Data & Statistics:** Real numbers from actual stock data
- **Charts & Visualizations:** Embedded images showing trends
- **Analysis:** AI-generated insights based on the data
- **SEO Elements:** Keywords and structure for web publishing

The report is in Markdown format (`.md` file) which can be:
