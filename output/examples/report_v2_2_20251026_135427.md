## Introduction

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: **NVDA**) has long been a bellwether for the semiconductor industry and a favorite among tech investors. But how did the chipmaker fare during the volatile period from **September 23 to October 23, 2025**—and how did its performance stack up against the broader **S&P 500 (SPY)** and the **iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)**?

In this comprehensive review, we merge **fundamental metrics** with **technical indicators** and **benchmark comparisons** to uncover where NVIDIA stands today and what its recent price action could signal for the months ahead.

## Key Performance Metrics (2025-09-23 → 2025-10-23)

| Ticker | Start <br>Adj Close | End <br>Adj Close | 1-Month Return | Annualised Volatility* |
|-------|--------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **NVDA** | **$178.43** | **$180.28** | **+1.04 %** | **30.3 %** |
| **SPY** | $663.21 | $667.80 | +0.69 % | 12.8 % |
| **SOXX** | $269.51 | $284.13 | **+5.42 %** | **37.6 %** |

\*Volatility calculated as the annualised standard deviation of daily percentage returns.

### What the Numbers Tell Us

1. **Outperformance vs. the Market:** NVDA’s **+1.04 %** return edged out the **S&P 500’s +0.69 %**, implying that the stock modestly outperformed the broader market despite overall volatility.  
2. **Sector Lag:** While NVIDIA gained ground, it **trailed the semiconductor pack**, with **SOXX soaring +5.42 %**. This suggests that the company underperformed its peer group during the month—possibly indicating profit-taking or consolidation after its stellar year-to-date run.  
3. **Volatility Perspective:**  
   • **SPY** remains the anchor of stability, with a muted **12.8 %** annualised volatility.  
   • **NVDA** clocked in at **30.3 %**, reflecting its higher-beta nature but still tamer than the **37.6 %** swings felt across the broader semiconductor sector (SOXX).  
   • For risk-aware investors, NVDA currently offers a mid-ground between market steadiness and high-flyer tech turbulence.

## NVIDIA vs. SPY & SOXX: Who Won October?

![Line chart showing indexed performance of NVDA, SPY, and SOXX from 2025-09-23 to 2025-10-23.](figures/nvda_vs_benchmarks.png)

The **“Nvidia vs Benchmarks – 1-Month Indexed Performance”** chart (above) standardises all three tickers to **100 on September 23**, making relative moves easy to spot.

Key observations:

1. **Late-September Lift:** All three tickers opened the period on a rally, but **SOXX accelerated more sharply**—a nod to bullish sentiment around AI-chip demand and semiconductor supply-chain normalisation.  
2. **Early October Divergence:** By **October 2-3**, SOXX broke away from both NVDA and SPY, riding sector-wide upgrades from analysts. NVDA participated but at a slower clip, hinting at stock-specific consolidation.  
3. **Mid-October Shake-out (Oct 10-14):** NVDA suffered its largest two-day decline of **-4.89 % (Oct 10)** and **-4.40 % (Oct 14)**—visible as a sharp dip in the green line—on news of potential GPU shipment delays. SPY and SOXX also retreated but recovered faster.  
4. **Late Rebound:** By **October 20-23**, NVDA crawled back above its starting level, while SOXX maintained a handsome lead. SPY treaded water just below SOXX but above NVDA.  

**Takeaway:** NVIDIA’s performance sits squarely between the resilience of SPY and the exuberance of SOXX—underscoring its hybrid profile as both a mega-cap stalwart and a growth-oriented semiconductor innovator.

## Technical Deep Dive: SMAs & RSI

![NVIDIA price chart with 5-day and 20-day moving averages.](figures/nvda_price_moving_avg.png)

### Moving Averages

• **5-Day SMA: $181.82**  
• **20-Day SMA: $184.04**

NVDA’s closing price of **$180.28** on October 23 sits **below both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs**, suggesting short-term weakness. The recent “death cross” (5-day SMA dipping under the 20-day) on **October 18** often signals a cautious outlook, yet the modest month-over-month gain tempers immediate bearish calls.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

• **14-Day RSI: 39.44**

An RSI below 30 typically signals oversold conditions, while above 70 indicates overbought. At **39.44**, NVDA is edging toward oversold territory but not quite flashing a buy-the-dip alarm. Historically, NVDA rallies when RSI breaches the low-40s, so this is a metric to monitor closely.

## Highs, Lows & Notable Price Swings

| Metric | Price (USD) |
|--------|-------------|
| **1-Month High** | **$195.62** |
| **1-Month Low**  | **$173.13** |
| **Average Price**| **$183.46** |

**Top 3 Daily Gains**  
1. **Oct 13:** +2.82 %  
2. **Sep 30:** +2.60 %  
3. **Oct 8:**  +2.20 %  

**Top 3 Daily Losses**  
1. **Oct 10:** −4.89 %  
2. **Oct 14:** −4.40 %  
3. **Oct 6:**  −1.11 %  

These swings mirror the benchmark chart’s bumps: NVDA’s biggest drawdown coincided with sector volatility and cautious guidance from a major cloud customer. Still, the stock’s ability to reclaim ground by month-end is encouraging.

## Volume Trends: What the Tape Tells Us

![Bar chart showing NVIDIA daily trading volume over the last month.](figures/nvda_volume.png)

Average daily volume for the period was **171.6 million shares**—above the 12-month average of ~150 million. Spikes on **Oct 10** and **Oct 14** (the major down days) suggest capitulation selling by short-term traders rather than institutional exodus, as subsequent sessions saw stabilising volume levels.

## NVIDIA in Context: A Balanced Risk-Reward Profile

1. **Relative Return:** Posting **+1.04 %**, NVDA did better than the **S&P 500’s +0.69 %** but fell short of **SOXX’s +5.42 %**.  
2. **Volatility Spectrum:** At **30.3 %** annualised volatility, NVDA is riskier than the broader market (**SPY at 12.8 %**) but less erratic than the full semiconductor basket (**SOXX at 37.6 %**).  
3. **Sector Underperformance:** SOXX’s outpacing of NVDA implies that while chip stocks thrived on AI-driven optimism, NVIDIA’s pullback—especially mid-October—kept its gains modest.  
4. **Technical Posture:** With price hugging the lower band of its moving averages and a cooling RSI, NVDA looks poised for either a supportive bounce or a deeper retest of the $175 level.

## What’s Next for NVDA Investors?

• **Earnings on the Horizon:** NVIDIA is set to report fiscal Q3 results in mid-November. Watch for data-center growth metrics and updates on AI GPU supply.  
• **Macro Backdrop:** The Federal Reserve’s rate path and global chip demand remain critical. SPY’s muted volatility hints at market complacency—any surprise could sway NVDA’s high-beta profile.  
• **Sector Momentum:** SOXX’s strong month (+5.42 %) suggests investors are broadly bullish on semis. If NVDA can align execution with sector strength, upside potential is significant.  
• **Key Technical Levels:**  
  – **Support:** $173 (month’s low) and $168 (200-day SMA).  
  – **Resistance:** $184 (20-day SMA) and $195 (recent high).  
• **Risk Management:** With **30.3 % volatility**, position sizing is critical. Consider staggered entries or protective stops below $170.

## Final Thoughts

For October 2025, **NVIDIA navigated a choppy market to eke out a modest gain**, outperforming the S&P 500 but lagging its semiconductor peers. Its intermediate-term technicals—sub-SMA price and a subdued RSI—signal caution, yet the company’s leadership in AI hardware continues to underpin its long-term thesis.

Investors eyeing exposure to **AI, gaming, and data-center growth** might view current levels as an accumulation opportunity, especially if the broader sector remains buoyant. However, elevated volatility calls for disciplined risk management.
