# Nvidia in Focus: October 2025 Stock Performance vs. Key Competitors

The semiconductor arena has been ablaze this fall, with artificial-intelligence tailwinds, supply-chain realignments, and an uptick in data-center demand all vying for investors’ attention. Nvidia (NASDAQ: **NVDA**) remains the torch-bearer of GPU innovation, but how has its share price actually fared over the past month compared with rivals Advanced Micro Devices (**AMD**), Intel (**INTC**), and Qualcomm (**QCOM**)—and against broader benchmarks like the S&P 500 ETF (**SPY**) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (**SOXX**)?

Using fresh market data from 23 September 2025 through 23 October 2025, we crunched the numbers, plotted the moves, and parsed the signals. Below is a 1,500-word deep dive into what just happened, why it matters, and where the chips may fall next.

## Quick Snapshot (23 Sep → 23 Oct 2025)

| Ticker | Start Adj Close | End Adj Close | 1-Month Return | Annualised Volatility |
| :----: | --------------: | ------------: | -------------: | --------------------: |
| **NVDA** | \$178.43 | \$180.28 | **+1.04 %** | **30.3 %** |
| **AMD**  | \$160.90 | \$230.23 | **+43.09 %** | **99.9 %** |
| **INTC** | \$29.34 | \$36.92 | **+25.84 %** | **57.3 %** |
| **QCOM** | \$169.53 | \$169.27 | **-0.15 %** | **37.0 %** |
| **SPY**  | \$663.21 | \$667.80 | +0.69 % | 12.8 % |
| **SOXX** | \$269.51 | \$284.13 | +5.42 % | 37.6 % |

Nvidia eked out a modest 1 % gain—handily beating the S&P 500’s 0.69 % yet trailing both the semiconductor ETF (+5.42 %) and, dramatically, AMD’s **eye-popping 43 %** rally.

## Nvidia’s 1-Month Price Action

### Price & Moving Averages

Our model tracks the 5-day and 20-day simple moving averages (SMA):

* SMA-5: **\$181.82**  
* SMA-20: **\$184.04**

With NVDA’s closing price at \$180.28, the stock sits just below both short- and medium-term averages—a sign that momentum has cooled following its summer sprint. The **High-Low Average** of \$183.46 encapsulates the current tug-of-war between profit-takers and dip-buyers.

### RSI & Technical Posture

NVDA’s 14-day Relative Strength Index (**RSI**) of **39.4** flirts with oversold territory (< 30). While not yet screaming “buy,” the subdued RSI suggests selling pressure may be near exhaustion.

### Volume Trends

Average daily volume over the period registered **171.6 M** shares, implying healthy trading interest. Notably:

* **Biggest uptick:** 13 Oct 2025, +2.82 % on heavy volume—investors cheered a bullish AI chip demand update.  
* **Sharpest pullback:** 10 Oct 2025, ‑4.89 % after mixed inflation data spooked growth stocks.

## Benchmarks Check: NVDA vs. SPY & SOXX

Why benchmark against **SPY** and **SOXX**?

1. **SPY (S&P 500 ETF)** provides a yardstick for the overall U.S. equity market.  
2. **SOXX (iShares Semiconductor ETF)** captures the broader chip-maker cohort.

![NVDA vs. Benchmarks](figures/nvda_vs_benchmarks.png)

Key takeaways:

• **Outperforming the Market, Lagging the Sector:** NVDA’s 1.04 % gain tops SPY but pales versus SOXX’s 5.42 %.  
• **Volatility Gap:** NVDA’s 30.3 % annualised volatility is more than double SPY’s 12.8 %, yet slightly below SOXX’s 37.6 %, reflecting sector-specific gyrations.

## Nvidia vs. Key Semiconductor Competitors

### The New Chart

![NVDA vs. Competitors](figures/nvda_vs_competitors.png)

The visualization normalizes all four stocks to **100** on 23 Sept, letting us see relative out- or under-performance at a glance.

### What the Numbers Say

1. **AMD (Ticker: AMD)**  
   • **Return:** +43.1 % – A blistering run, driven by strong demand for its Zen 5 CPUs and sizable AI GPU design wins.  
   • **Volatility:** 99.9 % – Nearly triple NVDA’s, underscoring the magnitude of the rally’s swings.

2. **Intel (Ticker: INTC)**  
   • **Return:** +25.8 % – A surprisingly strong month as the company’s foundry plans gained credibility after securing a major hyperscale client.  
   • **Volatility:** 57.3 % – Elevated, but far below AMD’s.

3. **Qualcomm (Ticker: QCOM)**  
   • **Return:** –0.15 % – Essentially flat; smartphone demand worries and regulatory headlines offset gains from automotive chips.  
   • **Volatility:** 37.0 % – Roughly in line with sector peers.

4. **Nvidia (Ticker: NVDA)**  
   • **Return:** +1.0 % – Respectable, yet dwarfed by AMD and INTC’s surges.  
   • **Volatility:** 30.3 % – Lower than most peers, hinting at relative price stability amid sector churn.

### Interpreting the Divergence

• **Rotation Within Semis:** Money flowed aggressively toward perceived underdogs (AMD, INTC) on expectations of catch-up gains in AI and foundry markets.  
• **Profit-Taking in Leaders:** Nvidia, after tripling YTD, encountered resistance as investors locked in profits, even as fundamentals remained firm.  
• **Qualcomm’s Mixed Bag:** Exposure to a sluggish handset market kept QCOM range-bound despite advancements in RF front-end and automotive chips.

## What Sets Nvidia Apart in Late 2025?

1. **AI Ecosystem Dominance:** While AMD is closing the gap with its MI300 accelerators, Nvidia’s CUDA software moat and partnerships with cloud titans continue to command premium valuations.  
2. **Data-Center Tailwinds:** Hyperscale and sovereign AI projects underpin secular demand that may extend well into 2026.  
3. **Balanced Risk Profile:** NVDA’s 30 % volatility, although high versus the broader market, is comparatively tame within high-beta semis—potentially attractive to risk-aware growth investors.

## Risk Check: Volatility & Macro Wildcards

• **Macroeconomic Uncertainty:** The U.S. 10-year yield’s flirtation with 5 % rattles tech multiples.  
• **Geopolitical Tensions:** Export restrictions on advanced chips to certain regions could cap near-term upside.  
• **Competitive Pressures:** AMD’s pricing strategy and Intel’s foundry ambitions are real threats, evidenced by their stock pops this month.

---

## Investment Takeaways

1. **Momentum Shifts:** Short-term traders may find greater upside volatility in AMD, but NVDA offers a steadier AI-centric growth profile.  
2. **Diversified Exposure:** An equal-weighted basket of NVDA, AMD, and INTC captured a blended 23 % gain—outperforming SOXX’s 5.4 %.  
3. **Watch the Technicals:** NVDA hovering below its 20-day SMA plus an RSI near 40 presents a potential swing-trade entry if fundamental conviction is strong.

## Conclusion

Nvidia’s October kept the AI leader modestly in the green, yet the spotlight shifted to rivals AMD and Intel with double-digit surges. Volatility across the semiconductor landscape remains elevated, but NVDA’s risk-adjusted profile could still appeal to investors betting on the next wave of generative-AI hardware.

Stay tuned: earnings season is around the corner, and with it, fresh catalysts that could either reignite Nvidia’s rally or further broaden the competitive playing field.
