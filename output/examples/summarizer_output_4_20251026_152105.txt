  "summary": {
    "objective": "Improve visualization quality and update blog accordingly.",
    "progress": [
      "Engineer delivered new Python script `generate_nvda_charts.py` that: (a) refetches 1-month data for NVDA, AMD, INTC, QCOM, SOXX, SPY; (b) recalculates returns/volatilities; (c) creates three high-resolution figures with Matplotlib dark-grid style; (d) saves data & images to prescribed paths; (e) contains no interactive calls.",
      "Handled environment issues: removed seaborn dependency and switched to Matplotlib’s built-in style; added robust extraction of the ‘Adj Close’ panel to avoid KeyError.",
      "Executor ran script successfully; data saved to data/semis_1mo_raw.csv; figures generated:\n    • figures/nvda_vs_competitors.png\n    • figures/nvda_vs_benchmarks.png\n    • figures/semis_risk_return.png",
      "Latest metrics captured (Return % / Volatility %):\n    NVDA +1.04 / 31.1, AMD +43.09 / 102.4, INTC +25.84 / 58.7, QCOM –0.15 / 38.0, SOXX +5.42 / 38.5, SPY +0.69 / 13.1",
      "Writer produced a fully-updated ~1,600-word SEO blog post integrating new visuals, metric table, and a risk-return interpretation section.",
      "Planner caught and corrected a minor numerical error: peer-average volatility updated from 56 % to ~47 % in the Risk-Return section; Writer fixed the sentence accordingly."
    ],
    "key_findings": {
      "Visuals": "Three polished, labelled, high-DPI charts generated; new risk-return scatter introduced.",
      "Performance": "AMD & INTC far outperformed NVDA; NVDA modest gain with moderate volatility; SPY lowest risk/return.",
      "Risk-Return": "AMD in high-risk/high-return quadrant; NVDA moderate risk, low return relative to peers."

    "action_items": [
      "Final review & formatting of blog post in next iteration (if any minor tweaks required).",
      "Verify figure embedding paths work on publishing platform.",
      "Optional: add alt-text for accessibility."

    "code_improvements": [
      "Eliminated seaborn dependency; used Matplotlib style fallback.",
      "Robust handling of yfinance MultiIndex columns; drops empty tickers and warns.",
      "Added market-cap-based bubble sizing with default fallback.",
      "Comprehensive logging and error handling."
    ],
    "writing_improvements": [
      "Inserted updated metrics and corrected average volatility figure.",
      "Added detailed analysis of risk-return scatter.",
